# EncryptImage
An Android app that encrypts and decrypts text messages in images. It does this by storing every character of the message in the alpha bits of several pixels in the image. The alpha bits are normally used to store transparancy but in this case it stores a message. This is a neat trick you can use to hide any secret messages you've got. Only people with the app can decrypt and encrypt those images. These images are practically indistinguishable from other regular images.
